name: Device IPv4 Static Route
rest_endpoint: /api/fmc_config/v1/domain/{DOMAIN_UUID}/devices/devicerecords/%v/routing/ipv4staticroutes
doc_category: Devices
test_tags: [TF_VAR_device_id]
attributes:
  - tf_name: device_id
    type: String
    reference: true
    description: Id of the parent device.
    example: 76d24097-41c4-4558-a4d0-a8c07ac08470
    test_value: fmc_device_physical_interface.test.device_id
  - model_name: interfaceName
    tf_name: interface_logical_name
    type: String
    description:
      Logical name of the parent interface.
      For transparent mode, any bridge group member interface.
      For routed mode with bridge groups, any bridge group member interface for the BVI name.
    mandatory: true
    example: myinterface-0-1
    test_value: fmc_device_physical_interface.test.logical_name
  - model_name: type
    type: String
    description: Type of the object; this value is always 'IPv4StaticRoute'.
    computed: true
  - model_name: parent # dummy
    data_path: [links]
    tf_name: interface_id
    type: String
    write_only: true
    description:
      Id of the interface provided in `interface_logical_name`.
      The value is ignored, but the attribute itself is useful for ensuring that Terraform creates interface resource
      before the static route resource (and destroys the interface resource only after the static route has been
      destroyed).
    mandatory: true
    example: 76d24097-41c4-4558-a4d0-a8c07ac08470
    test_value: fmc_device_physical_interface.test.id
  - model_name: selectedNetworks
    tf_name: destination_networks
    description: Set of the destination networks matching this route (Host, Networks or Ranges).
    mandatory: true
    type: Set
    attributes:
      - model_name: id
        type: String
        description: Id of the object.
        id: true
        example: 76d24097-41c4-4558-a4d0-a8c07ac08470
        test_value: data.fmc_network.test.id
  - model_name: metricValue
    type: Int64
    description: >-
      The cost of the route. The metric is used to compare routes among different routing protocols. The default
      administrative distance for static routes is 1, giving it precedence over routes discovered by dynamic routing
      protocols but not directly connected routes.
    min_int: 1
    max_int: 254
    example: 254
    minimum_test_value: "254"
    test_value: "null"
  - model_name: id
    data_path: [gateway, object]
    tf_name: gateway_host_object_id
    description: >-
      Id of the next hop for this route. Exactly one of `gateway_host_object_id`
      or `gateway_host_literal` must be present.
    type: String
    exclude_example: true
    exclude_test: true
  - model_name: value
    data_path: [gateway, literal]
    tf_name: gateway_host_literal
    type: String
    description: >-
      Next hop for this route as a literal IPv4 address. Exactly one of `gateway_host_object_id`
      or `gateway_host_literal` must be present.
    example: 10.0.0.1
    minimum_test_value: '"10.0.0.2"'
  - model_name: isTunneled
    type: Bool
    description:
      Indicates whether this route is a separate default route for VPN traffic. Should be used for default
      route only (such as when the destination_networks points to a builtin network 'any-ipv4'). Useful
      if you want VPN traffic to use a different default route than non-VPN traffic.
      When a tunnel terminates on the device, all traffic from it that cannot be routed using learned or static routes
      is sent to this route. You can configure only one default tunneled gateway per device. ECMP for tunneled traffic
      is not supported. This attribute conflicts with `metric_value` attribute.
    exclude_example: true
    default_value: "false"
    test_value: "true"
