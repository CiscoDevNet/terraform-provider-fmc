res_description: >-
  This plural resource manages a bulk of Dynamic Objects.
  The FMC API supports quick bulk creation and deletion of this resource. Modification is always done one-by-one. Refresh is done in bulk for all objects and one-by-one for evey object that has mapping defined.
  Updating/deleting `fmc_dynamic_objects` can thus take much more time than creating it
