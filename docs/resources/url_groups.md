# fmc_url_groups (Resource)

This resource manages URL Groups through bulk operations.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Minimum FMC version for bulk object deletion: `7.4`

  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_url_groups" "example" {
  items = {
    my_url_groups = {
      description = "My URL group"
      urls = [
        {
          id = "0050568A-FAC7-0ed3-0000-004294987896"
        }
      ]
      literals = [
        {
