  Resource for Policy Device Assignments in FMC
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "fmc_policy_devices_assignments" "policy_assignment" {
      policy {
          id = fmc_access_policies.access_policy.id
          type = fmc_access_policies.access_policy.type
      }
      target_devices {
          id = data.fmc_devices.device.id
          type = data.fmc_devices.device.type
      }
  }
  
  Note You cannot delete a policy assignment, only reassign the devices to another policy. So, the delete operation on terraform does nothing, but the assignment is not deleted until you have manually moved the devices to another policy.
