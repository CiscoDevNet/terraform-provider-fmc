- `host_name` (String) Hostname or IP address of the device. Either the host_name or nat_id must be present.
- `license_capabilities` (Set of String) Array of strings representing the license capabilities on the managed device. ESSENTIALS is mandatory

- `name` (String) User-specified name, must be unique.
- `registration_key` (String) Registration Key identical to the one previously configured on the device (`configure manager`).

### Optional

- `device_group_id` (String) ID of the device group.
- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain
- `health_policy_id` (String) The UUID of the assigned Health policy.
- `nat_id` (String) (used for device registration behind NAT) If the device to be registered and the Firepower Management Center are separated by network address translation (NAT), set a unique string identifier.
