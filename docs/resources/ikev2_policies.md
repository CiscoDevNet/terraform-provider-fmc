# fmc_ikev2_policies (Resource)

This resource manages IKEv2 Policies through bulk operations.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Bulk object creation is not supported by FMC, it will be handled one-by-one
  - Bulk object deletion is not supported by FMC, it will be handled one-by-one
  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_ikev2_policies" "example" {
  items = {
    my_ikev2_policies = {
      description           = "IKEv2 Policy"
      priority              = 10
      lifetime              = 86400
      integrity_algorithms  = ["SHA-256"]
      encryption_algorithms = ["AES-256"]
      prf_algorithms        = ["SHA-256"]
      dh_groups             = ["14"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Required:

- `dh_groups` (Set of String) IKEv2 Diffie-Hellman groups.
  - Choices: `1`, `2`, `5`, `14`, `15`, `16`, `19`, `20`, `21`, `24`, `31`
- `encryption_algorithms` (Set of String) IKEv2 Encryption algorithms.
  - Choices: `DES`, `3DES`, `AES`, `AES-192`, `AES-256`, `AES-GCM`, `AES-GCM-192`, `AES-GCM-256`, `NULL`
- `integrity_algorithms` (Set of String) IKEv2 Integrity algorithms.
  - Choices: `SHA`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-384`, `SHA-512`, `MD5`, `NULL`
- `lifetime` (Number) Lifetime in seconds.
  - Range: `120`-`2147483647`
- `prf_algorithms` (Set of String) IKEv2 Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) algorithms.
  - Choices: `SHA`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-384`, `SHA-512`, `MD5`
- `priority` (Number) Priority of the IKEv1 Policy.
  - Range: `1`-`65535`

Optional:

- `description` (String) Description of the object.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Id of the IKEv2 Policy object.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this value is always 'IKEv2Policy'.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import fmc_ikev2_policies.example "<domain>,[<ikev2_policies_name>]"
```
