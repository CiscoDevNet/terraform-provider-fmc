This resource manages Port Groups through bulk operations.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Minimum FMC version for bulk object deletion: `7.4`

  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_port_groups" "example" {
  items = {
    my_port_groups = {
      description = "My port group description"
      objects = [
        {
          id   = "0050568A-232D-0ed3-0000-004294971602"
          type = "ProtocolPortObject"
        }

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# <domain> is optional. If not provided, `Global` is used implicitly and resource's `domain` attribute is not set.
terraform import fmc_port_groups.example "<domain>,[<item1_name>,<item2_name>,...]"
```
