## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_dns_server_groups" "example" {
  items = {
    my_dns_server_groups = {
      default_domain = "example.com"
      timeout        = 2
      retries        = 2
      dns_servers = [
        {
          ip = "10.10.10.1"

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# <domain> is optional. If not provided, `Global` is used implicitly and resource's `domain` attribute is not set.
terraform import fmc_dns_server_groups.example "<domain>,[<item1_name>,<item2_name>,...]"
```
