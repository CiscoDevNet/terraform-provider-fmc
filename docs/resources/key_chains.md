# fmc_key_chains (Resource)

This resource manages Key Chains through bulk operations.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Bulk object deletion is not supported by FMC, it will be handled one-by-one
  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_key_chains" "example" {
  items = {
    my_key_chains = {
      description = "My Host object"
      keys = [
        {
          id                       = 1
          key                      = "my_secret_key"
          accept_lifetime_start    = "2025-08-25T12:14:23"
          accept_lifetime_end_type = "DATETIME"
          accept_lifetime_end      = "2026-08-25T12:14:23"
          send_lifetime_start      = "2025-08-25T12:14:23"
          send_lifetime_end_type   = "DATETIME"
          send_lifetime_end        = "2026-08-25T12:14:23"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Required:

- `keys` (Attributes List) Keys (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--keys))

Optional:

- `description` (String) Description of the object.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Id of the Key Chain object.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this value is always 'KeyChainObject'.

<a id="nestedatt--items--keys"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.keys`

Required:

- `id` (Number) Key ID.
  - Range: `0`-`255`
- `key` (String) Crypto key string.

Optional:

- `accept_lifetime_end` (String) End time for key acceptance lifetime.
- `accept_lifetime_end_type` (String) Type of end time for key acceptance lifetime.
  - Choices: `INFINITE`, `DURATION`, `DATETIME`
- `accept_lifetime_start` (String) Start time for key acceptance lifetime.
- `send_lifetime_end` (String) End time for key send lifetime.
- `send_lifetime_end_type` (String) Type of end time for key send lifetime.
  - Choices: `INFINITE`, `DURATION`, `DATETIME`
- `send_lifetime_start` (String) Start time for key send lifetime.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# <domain> is optional. If not provided, `Global` is used implicitly and resource's `domain` attribute is not set.
terraform import fmc_key_chains.example "<domain>,[<item1_name>,<item2_name>,...]"
```
