# fmc_ikev2_ipsec_proposals (Resource)

This resource manages IKEv2 IPsec Proposals through bulk operations.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Bulk object creation is not supported by FMC, it will be handled one-by-one
  - Bulk object deletion is not supported by FMC, it will be handled one-by-one
  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_ikev2_ipsec_proposals" "example" {
  items = {
    my_ikev2_ipsec_proposals = {
      description    = "IKEv2 IPsec Proposal 1"
      esp_encryption = ["AES-256"]
      esp_hash       = ["SHA-256"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `items` (Attributes Map) Map of IKEv2 IPsec Proposals. The key of the map is the name of the individual IKEv2 IPSec Proposal. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Required:

- `esp_encryption` (Set of String) Set of IKEv2 Encryption algorithms.
  - Choices: `3DES`, `AES`, `AES-192`, `AES-256`, `AES-GCM`, `AES-GCM-192`, `AES-GCM-256`, `AES-GMAC`, `AES-GMAC-192`, `AES-GMAC-256`, `DES`, `NULL`
- `esp_hash` (Set of String) Set of IKEv2 Hash algorithms.
  - Choices: `MD5`, `NULL`, `SHA-1`, `SHA-256`, `SHA-384`, `SHA-512`

Optional:

- `description` (String) Description of the object.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Id of the IKEv2 IPSec Proposal object.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this value is always 'IKEv2IPsecProposal'.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import fmc_ikev2_ipsec_proposals.example "<domain>,[<ikev2_ipsec_proposals_name>]"
```
