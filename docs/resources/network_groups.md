# fmc_network_groups (Resource)

This resource manages Network Groups through bulk operations.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Minimum FMC version for bulk object deletion: `7.4`
  - If FMC version does not meet the minimum version requirement for bulk operations, this resource will automatically fall back to processing operations one-by-one.
  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_network_groups" "example" {
  items = {
    my_network_groups = {
      description    = "My Network Group 1"
      network_groups = ["child_group_1"]
      objects = [
        {
          id   = "cf271be2-e80d-4033-8e1d-285f133a5f8c"
          name = "fmc_network_object_1"
        }
      ]
      literals = [
        {
          value = "10.1.1.0/24"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain
- `items` (Attributes Map) Map of Network Groups. The key of the map is the name of the individual Network Group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Optional:

- `description` (String) Description of the object.
- `literals` (Attributes Set) Set of literal values. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--literals))
- `network_groups` (Set of String) Set of names (not Ids) of child Network Groups. The names must be defined in the same instance of `fmc_network_groups` resource. This is an auxiliary way to add a child Network Group: the suggested way is to instead add it inside `objects` by its Ids.
- `objects` (Attributes Set) Set of network objects (Hosts, Networks, Ranges, FQDNs or Network Group). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--objects))
- `overridable` (Boolean) Whether the object values can be overridden.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Id of the Network Group.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this value is always 'NetworkGroup'.

<a id="nestedatt--items--literals"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.literals`

Optional:

- `value` (String) IP address or network in CIDR format. Please do not use /32 mask for host.


<a id="nestedatt--items--objects"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.objects`

Optional:

- `id` (String) Id of the network object.
- `name` (String) Name of the network object.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import fmc_network_groups.example "<id>"
```
