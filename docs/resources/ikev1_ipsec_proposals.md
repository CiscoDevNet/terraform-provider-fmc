# fmc_ikev1_ipsec_proposals (Resource)

This resource manages IKEv1 IPsec Proposals through bulk operations.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Bulk object creation is not supported by FMC, it will be handled one-by-one
  - Bulk object deletion is not supported by FMC, it will be handled one-by-one
  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_ikev1_ipsec_proposals" "example" {
  items = {
    my_ikev1_ipsec_proposals = {
      description    = "IKEv1 IPsec Proposal 1"
      esp_encryption = "AES-192"
      esp_hash       = "SHA"
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `items` (Attributes Map) Map of IKEv1 IPsec Proposals. The key of the map is the name of the individual IKEv1 IPSec Proposal. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Required:

- `esp_encryption` (String) ESP Encryption algorithm.
  - Choices: `DES`, `3DES`, `ESP_NULL`, `AES-128`, `AES-192`, `AES-256`
- `esp_hash` (String) ESP Hash algorithm.
  - Choices: `SHA`, `NONE`, `MD5`

Optional:

- `description` (String) Description of the object.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Id of the IKEv1 IPSec Proposal object.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this value is always 'IKEv1IPsecProposal'.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# <domain> is optional. If not provided, `Global` is used implicitly and resource's `domain` attribute is not set.
terraform import fmc_ikev1_ipsec_proposals.example "<domain>,[<item1_name>,<item2_name>,...]"
```
