# fmc_icmpv6_objects (Resource)

This resource manages ICMPv6 Objects through bulk operations.
This object is deprecated. Please use `fmc_icmpv6s` instead.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Minimum FMC version for bulk object deletion: `7.4`
  - If FMC version does not meet the minimum version requirement for bulk operations, this resource will automatically fall back to processing operations one-by-one.
  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_icmpv6_objects" "example" {
  items = {
    my_icmpv6_objects = {
      icmp_type   = "1"
      code        = 3
      description = "ICMPv6 address unreachable response, type 1, code 3"
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `items` (Attributes Map) Map of icmpv6s. The key of the map is the name of the individual ICMPv6 Object. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Optional:

- `code` (Number) Code number subordinate to the given `icmp_type`.
  - Range: `0`-`255`
- `description` (String) Description of the object.
- `icmp_type` (String) Type number, or `Any` for any type.
- `overridable` (Boolean) Indicates whether object values can be overridden.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Id of the managed ICMPv6 object.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this value is always 'ICMPV6Object'.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# <domain> is optional. If not provided, `Global` is used implicitly and resource's `domain` attribute is not set.
terraform import fmc_icmpv6_objects.example "<domain>,[<item1_name>,<item2_name>,...]"
```
