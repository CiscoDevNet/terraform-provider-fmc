<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Required:

- `interface_type` (String) The mode of the associated interfaces, with the exception of mode ROUTED that corresponds to mode NONE of associated interfaces.
  - Choices: `PASSIVE`, `INLINE`, `SWITCHED`, `ROUTED`, `ASA`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# <domain> is optional. If not provided, `Global` is used implicitly and resource's `domain` attribute is not set.
terraform import fmc_security_zones.example "<domain>,[<item1_name>,<item2_name>,...]"
```
