# fmc_fqdn_objects (Resource)

This resource manages a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) Object through bulk operations.
This resource is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `fmc_fqdns` instead.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Minimum FMC version for bulk object deletion: `7.4`
  - If FMC version does not meet the minimum version requirement for bulk operations, this resource will automatically fall back to processing operations one-by-one.
  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_fqdn_objects" "example" {
  items = {
    my_fqdns = {
      description    = "My FQDN 1"
      fqdn           = "www.example.com"
      dns_resolution = "IPV4_AND_IPV6"
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `items` (Attributes Map) Map of FQDN Objects. The key of the map is the name of the individual FQDN Object. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Required:

- `fqdn` (String) Fully Qualified Domain Name.

Optional:

- `description` (String) Description of the object.
- `dns_resolution` (String) Type of DNS resolution.
  - Choices: `IPV4_ONLY`, `IPV6_ONLY`, `IPV4_AND_IPV6`
  - Default value: `IPV4_AND_IPV6`
- `overridable` (Boolean) Whether the object values can be overridden.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Id of the FQDN object.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this value is always 'FQDN'.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# <domain> is optional. If not provided, `Global` is used implicitly and resource's `domain` attribute is not set.
terraform import fmc_fqdn_objects.example "<domain>,[<item1_name>,<item2_name>,...]"
```
