```terraform
resource "fmc_networks" "example" {
  items = {
    my_networks_object = {

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Required:

- `prefix` (String) Prefix of the network.

Optional:

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# <domain> is optional. If not provided, `Global` is used implicitly and resource's `domain` attribute is not set.
terraform import fmc_networks.example "<domain>,[<item1_name>,<item2_name>,...]"
```
