# fmc_icmpv4_objects (Resource)

This resource manages ICMPv4 Objects through bulk operations.

The following restrictions apply:
  - Minimum FMC version for bulk object deletion: `7.4`
  - If FMC version does not meet the minimum version requirement for bulk operations, this resource will automatically fall back to processing operations one-by-one.
  - Updates are always done one-by-one.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "fmc_icmpv4_objects" "example" {
  items = {
    my_icmpv4_objects = {
      description = "ICMPv4 network unreachable response, type 3, code 0"
      icmp_type   = 3
      code        = 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `items` (Attributes Map) Map of icmpv4s. The key of the map is the name of the individual ICMPv4 Object. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Optional:

- `code` (Number) ICMPv4 [code number](https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml) subordinate to the given `icmp_type`.
  - Range: `0`-`255`
- `description` (String) Description of the object.
- `icmp_type` (Number) ICMPv4 [type number](https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml).
  - Range: `0`-`255`
- `overridable` (Boolean) Indicates whether object values can be overridden.

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) Id of the managed ICMPv4 object.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this value is always 'ICMPV4Object'.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import fmc_icmpv4_objects.example "<domain>,[<icmpv4_objects_name>]"
```
