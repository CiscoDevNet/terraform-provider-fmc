# fmc_time_ranges (Data Source)

This data source reads the Time Ranges.

data "fmc_time_ranges" "example" {
  items = {
    "my_time_ranges" = {
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain
- `items` (Attributes Map) Map of Time Ranges. The key of the map is the name of the individual Time Range. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `description` (String) Description of the object.
- `end_time` (String) Date and time at which the time range object stops being effective. If not specified 'never ends' is assumed.
- `id` (String) Id of the Time Range.
- `recurrence_list` (Attributes List) List of recurring intervals during which the time range is effective. These intervals are valid only between `start_time` and `end_time`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--recurrence_list))
- `start_time` (String) Date and time at which the time range object starts being effective. If not specified 'starts now' is assumed.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this is always 'TimeRange'.

<a id="nestedatt--items--recurrence_list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.recurrence_list`

Read-Only:

- `daily_days` (Set of String) List of days on which the time range is effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as DAILY_INTERVAL.
- `daily_end_time` (String) Time (in HH:MM format) at which the time range stops being effective on selected days. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as DAILY_INTERVAL.
- `daily_start_time` (String) Time (in HH:MM format) at which the time range starts being effective on selected days. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as DAILY_INTERVAL.
- `range_end_day` (String) Day of week at which the time range stops being effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as RANGE.
- `range_end_time` (String) Time (in HH:MM format) at which the time range stops being effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as RANGE.
- `range_start_day` (String) Day of week at which the time range starts being effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as RANGE.
- `range_start_time` (String) Time (in HH:MM format) at which the time range starts being effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as RANGE.
- `recurrence_type` (String) Type of the recurrence interval.
