## Schema

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain
- `id` (String) Id of the object
- `name` (String) Name of the Time Range object.

### Read-Only

- `description` (String) Description of the object.
- `end_time` (String) Date and time at which the time range object stops being effective. If not specified 'never ends' is assumed.
- `recurrence_list` (Attributes List) List of recurring intervals during which the time range is effective. These intervals are valid only between `start_time` and `end_time`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--recurrence_list))
- `start_time` (String) Date and time at which the time range object starts being effective. If not specified 'starts now' is assumed.
- `type` (String) Type of the object; this is always 'TimeRange'.

### Nested Schema for `recurrence_list`

Read-Only:

- `daily_days` (Set of String) List of days on which the time range is effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as DAILY_INTERVAL.
- `daily_end_time` (String) Time (in HH:MM format) at which the time range stops being effective on selected days. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as DAILY_INTERVAL.
- `daily_start_time` (String) Time (in HH:MM format) at which the time range starts being effective on selected days. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as DAILY_INTERVAL.
- `range_end_day` (String) Day of week at which the time range stops being effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as RANGE.
- `range_end_time` (String) Time (in HH:MM format) at which the time range stops being effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as RANGE.
- `range_start_day` (String) Day of week at which the time range starts being effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as RANGE.
- `range_start_time` (String) Time (in HH:MM format) at which the time range starts being effective. This field must be used if `recurrence_type` is specified as RANGE.
- `recurrence_type` (String) Type of the recurrence interval.
