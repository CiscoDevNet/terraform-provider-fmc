- `name` (String) Name of the object

### Read-Only

- `description` (String) Description of the object.
- `end_time` (String) Date and time at which the time range object stops being effective. If not specified 'never ends' is assumed.
- `recurrence_list` (Attributes List) List of recurring intervals during which the time range is effective. These intervals are valid only between start_time and end_time. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--recurrence_list))
