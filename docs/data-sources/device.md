## Schema

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain
- `id` (String) Id of the object
- `name` (String) Name of the device.

### Read-Only

- `access_control_policy_id` (String) Id of the assigned Access Control Policy.
- `container_id` (String) Id of the parent container. Empty if device is Standalone.
- `container_name` (String) Name of the parent container. Empty if device is Standalone.
- `container_role` (String) Role of the device in the container (PRIMARY, SECONDARY) for DeviceHAPair or (Control, Data) for DeviceCluster. Empty if device is Standalone.
- `container_status` (String) Status of the device in DeviceHAPair (Active, Standby, but other possible as well).
- `container_type` (String) Type of the parent container (DeviceHAPair or DeviceCluster). Empty if device is Standalone.
- `device_group_id` (String) Id of the device group.
- `health_policy_id` (String) Id of the assigned Health policy. Every device requires health policy assignment, hence removal of this attribute does not trigger health policy de-assignment.
- `host` (String) Hostname or IP address of the device. Either the `host_name` or `nat_id` must be present.
- `is_multi_instance` (Boolean) True if the device is part of a multi-instance.
- `is_part_of_container` (Boolean) True if the device is part of a container (DeviceHAPair or DeviceCluster).
- `licenses` (Set of String) Array of strings representing the license capabilities on the managed device.
- `nat_id` (String) (used for device registration behind NAT) If the device to be registered and the Firepower Management Center are separated by network address translation (NAT), set a unique string identifier.
- `nat_policy_id` (String) Id of the assigned FTD NAT policy.
- `object_group_search` (Boolean) Enables Object Group Search
- `performance_tier` (String) Performance tier for the managed device.
- `prohibit_packet_transfer` (Boolean) Value true prohibits the device from sending packet data with events to the Firepower Management Center. Value false allows the transfer when a certain event is triggered. Not all traffic data is sent; connection events do not include a payload, only connection metadata.
- `registration_key` (String) Registration Key identical to the one previously configured on the device (`configure manager`).
- `snort_engine` (String) SNORT engine version to be enabled.
- `type` (String) Type of the device; this value is always 'Device'.
