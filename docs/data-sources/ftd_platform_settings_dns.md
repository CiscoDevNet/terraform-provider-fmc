## Schema

### Required

- `ftd_platform_settings_id` (String) Id of the parent FTD Platform Settings.
- `id` (String) Id of the object

### Optional

- `domain` (String) Name of the FMC domain

### Read-Only

- `expire_entry_timer` (Number) Minimum time-to-live (TTL) for the DNS entry (in minutes).
