// terraform-plugin-framework v1.15.1 changed behaviour of UseStateForUnknown plan modifier.
// Before the change, if new nested map, that contains Computed/Unknown elements is added to already created resource,
// those elements are treated as Unknown.
// After the change, those elements are treated as Null.
// This breaks bulk operations, as the ID of newly created objects can never be set, as Terraform would expects them to be Null.
// Ref: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework/issues/1197
